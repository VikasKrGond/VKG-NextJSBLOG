 Yup ! you heard it right I'm talking about that poor guy who's having a temporary arrangment of the elevated platform made of bamboo used to sell roasted peanut. You know what I'm a great roasetd peanut lover I used to buy the peanut every next day of Rupee 10 on average back in 2017 . I used to eat that peanut with chutney along with black salt with some chat masala mixed with it and walk at the same time actually It was a integral part of my life . Recently again Iwent to the same **Mungfali Wale Bhayia** which once I frequently used to visit with No time he recognised me and greeted with the smile....**"Kya bhaiya! bhut dino baad"**. I said yeah a long time after almost after 3 years. I then stricked a converstion with him and talking side by side. My first question was **Bhaiya, how much you earn out of this**,he first hesitate but then he explained his cost break down He said he used to buy a raw peanuts in bulk from the big mandi at the cost of Rs 2000 per 50 kg which means Rs 50 per kg and then he used to shif it to his house he used to buy 40 such bags(2 tone or 2000kgs) for a season i.e of cost Rs 80,000 and Rupees 2000 as transportation and after thaat he used to Keep the Stock in a Room which costs him around 3,000 for a month he used to rent this room for October to Feb i.e. of 5 month and he has in house setup to roast the peanut in traditonal way which include **Iron Khadai filled with Salt and on wood fueled chulah** he used to roast around 12 kg of peanut every day and used to sell at Rs150 per Kg. Now certainly I started my calculations **Net Profit = (Selling Price per kg - (Cost of Raw Peanut+Roasting perkg+Paking and Chutney+ Heating cost))*2000-Rent of 6 months-Tranfortation cost** i.e. (150-(40+15))*2000-15000-2000 = 1,73,000 for 5 months  which is equal to around Rs34,600 per month** I thought It's really a tough job to sit in chauraha for 6-7 long hours that too in freezing cold and that too for Rs1,153 perday . As I discussed earlier I had an affair with the Enterpenurship and my love tech so after talking to the Bhaiya In my late night Walk after taking my Dinner It would be again around 12 midnight but that number from Mungfali wale bhaiya got stuck In my brain and Istarted Brainstorming of the I idea for the Startup **Moongfali Wali** in which I'll be solving the problem of inconsistency in quality,pricing,standerdisation SOP for the peanut and how to Increase the Wealth of the Mongwaliwale bhiaya to alteast 2x with this Idea. What I planned was to I'll create a standard Moongfali stall which have unform best quality of Moongfali and that too at the competitive price and with the help of Econmies of scale and Robust Supply Chain So here are the Numbers I used to procure the peanuts a few stages before the Mandi that is from the Farmers directly which will cost me around Rs 25 per kg and we used to buy it in massive Quantity like 10k tone i.e 1,00,00,000 Kg which cost us around 25Cr + 1 Cr for Transfortation and Roasting and storing in Werehouse so at last a final moongfali cost me around Rs 26 and due to our SOP and other arrange ment It'll at seling I costs us Rs 40 per kg and We have 500 peanut seller and every seller gets Rs 40 per Kg and He used to Sell it at Rs 150(Same as local) we are making the Gross Margin for Rs 80 per Kg and Due to our Marketing and Quality we have High Stock Rotation of 50 kg per seller per day which will Combinly have 25,000 kg perday + 30 Rs our operating cost(Logistics,Marketing,Ad,Emp Salary) per kg in last we have Net Profit of Rs 40 per kg and we used to sell 25,000 kg perday which means we used to earn 10,00,000 per day which means crazy 3,00,00,000(3Cr) per month . and Our Seller Used to earn Rs 60,000 per month directly almost 200% of what he'll be earning traditonally and all this without any extra cost to the Consumer.
